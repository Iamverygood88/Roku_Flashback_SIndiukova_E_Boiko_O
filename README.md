## Description

This is a Flashback app based on the Roku Canell service. This App gives you access to watch movies, TV shows and listen to a music. All these sections are divided by release year. In addition, the Roku Flashback App provides access to view content for adults as well as for children, according to the age restriction.

## Functionality

Roku Flashback App is a fully responsive website (mobile, tablet and desktop). The main usability function is the separation between kid's and adult's content. The App has a login system where you can log in to your profile and have access to the appropriate content. The adult user has the credentials to change the content for kid users. Also, we have an SQL database and all movies, TV shows and music information retrieving from the database.
